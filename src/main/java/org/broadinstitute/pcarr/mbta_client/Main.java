     * (1) List the "long name" for all subway routes.
     * 
     * (2) Write a program that writes these questions and their answers to the console:
     *   Which rail route has the most stops? 
     *   Which rail route has the fewest stops?  
     *   Which rail routes are connected? List the stops that connect them.
     * 
     * (3) Given any two stops on the rail routes you listed for question 1, list the rail routes you would travel to get from one to the other
     *   Examples: 
     *      Davis to Kendall -> Redline
     *      Ashmont to Arlington -> Redline, Greenline 
     *   How you handle input, represent train routes and present output is your choice
